    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        <b>Early Life and Background:</b>

        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on February 19, 1630, at the Shivneri Fort in the Pune district of
        Maharashtra, India. His father, Shahaji Raje Bhosale, was a nobleman and a general serving under the Deccan
        Sultanates, while his mother, Jijabai, was a devout and wise woman who played a significant role in shaping
        Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj character and values. Jijabai instilled in Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj a deep sense of duty, justice, and devotion to his
        people and religion. <br>

        <b>Foundation of the Maratha Empire: </b>

        From an early age, Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj demonstrated remarkable leadership qualities and a passion for independence. At the
        age of 16, he seized the Torna Fort, marking the beginning of his military career. Over the next few years, he
        captured several forts, including Raigad, Kondana (later renamed Sinhagad), and Pratapgad, establishing a strong
        base for his growing empire.

        In 1647,Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj formally established the Maratha Empire, laying the foundation for a kingdom that would
        challenge the dominance of the Mughal Empire and other regional powers. <br>

        <b>Military Achievements: </b>

        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is renowned for his innovative military tactics, particularly guerrilla warfare, which he used
        effectively to outmaneuver and defeat much larger and better-equipped enemy forces. His army was adept at quick,
        surprise attacks and retreats, exploiting the mountainous terrain of the Western Ghats to their advantage. <br>

        <b>Some of his notable military achievements include:</b><br>
        - The defeat of Afzal Khan, a formidable general of the Bijapur Sultanate, at the Battle of Pratapgad in 1659.
        <br>
        - The strategic capture of forts such as Panhala and Vishalgad, which strengthened his hold over the region.
        <br>
        - The successful naval expeditions and the establishment of a powerful Maratha navy to protect the Konkan
        coastline. <br>

        <b>Conflict with the Mughals:</b>

        Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj growing power brought him into conflict with the Mughal Empire. In 1666, he met the Mughal Emperor
        Aurangzeb in Agra, but the meeting resulted in his house arrest.Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj however, orchestrated a daring escape
        and returned to the Deccan, resuming his resistance against the Mughals. <br>

        <b>Coronation and Governance: </b>

        On June 6, 1674, Chhatrapati Shivaji was coronated as Chhatrapati (emperor) at Raigad Fort, formally establishing the
        Maratha Kingdom. His coronation marked the beginning of a new era, where Shivaji maharaj emphasized the importance of
        Swarajya (self-rule) and Hindavi Swarajya (rule of the indigenous people).

        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's administration was notable for its efficiency and inclusiveness. He implemented a system of governance
        that was fair, just, and aimed at the welfare of his subjects. His policies ensured the protection of peasants
        and promoted trade and agriculture. <br>

        <b>Religious Tolerance:</b>

        Although Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj was a devout Hindu, he was known for his religious tolerance and respect for all faiths. He
        employed people from various religious backgrounds in his administration and military, ensuring a diverse and
        harmonious society.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Afzal Khan's death at the hands of Shivaji Maharaj is a significant event in Indian
      history, marking a pivotal moment in the Maratha Empire's rise. Here's a detailed account of the encounter: <br>

      <b>Background</b>
      Afzal Khan was a powerful general of the Adil Shahi Sultanate of Bijapur, sent to crush the growing power of
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Deccan region. Afzal Khan had a reputation for his military prowess and was known for his
      brutal tactics. He intended to eliminate Chhatrapati Shivaji maharj and bring the Maratha territory under Bijapur's control. <br>

      <b>The Strategy </b>
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, aware of Afzal Khan's strength and the size of his army, decided to use strategy and guerrilla
      tactics instead of direct confrontation. Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj chose the dense forests of Pratapgad Fort as the meeting place,
      leveraging the difficult terrain to his advantage.

      Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj proposed a meeting with Afzal Khan to discuss terms of peace. Afzal Khan, underestimating Shivaji maharaj,
      accepted the proposal, believing it would be easy to capture or kill him during the meeting. <br>

      <b>The Encounter</b>
      On November 10, 1659, the two leaders met at the foothills of Pratapgad. Both leaders agreed to come unarmed to
      the meeting, but Shivaji suspected treachery. Shivaji wore hidden armor under his clothes and carried a concealed
      weapon known as a "wagh nakh" (tiger claws), along with a small dagger called a "bichuwa."

      As the meeting progressed, Afzal Khan tried to attack Shivaji by embracing him and attempting to strangle him.
      However, Shivaji swiftly retaliated by using the wagh nakh to disembowel Afzal Khan and then stabbed him with the
      bichuwa. Afzal Khan's bodyguards rushed in, but Shivaji's men, who were strategically positioned nearby, defended
      their leader. <br>

      <b> Aftermath </b>
      Afzal Khan's death demoralized the Bijapur forces. Shivaji's forces attacked the Bijapur army, which was in
      disarray after the loss of their leader. This encounter not only enhanced Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj reputation as a clever and
      courageous leader but also laid the foundation for the expansion of the Maratha Empire.

      The victory at Pratapgad was a turning point in Shivaji maharaj campaign against the Deccan Sultanates and significantly
      boosted the morale of his troops and supporters.

    </figure>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The defeat of Shaista Khan by Shivaji Maharaj is another significant event in the
      history of the Maratha Empire. Here is a detailed account of this event: <br>

      <b>Background</b>
      Shaista Khan was a Mughal general and a relative of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In 1660, Aurangzeb appointed
      Shaista Khan as the governor of the Deccan and tasked him with suppressing Shivaji Maharaj's growing power.
      Shaista Khan was an experienced commander with a large, well-equipped Mughal army.

      Shaista Khan captured Pune and made the Lal Mahal, a significant place in Shivaji maharajchildhood, his residence. He
      began launching campaigns against Shivaji's territories, capturing several key Maratha forts. <br>

      <b>Shivaji maharaj Strategy </b>
      Shivaji Maharaj, known for his guerrilla warfare tactics and strategic brilliance, decided to strike back with a
      surprise attack. He aimed to weaken Shaista Khan's position by attacking him at his base in Pune, within the
      heavily guarded Lal Mahal. The plan was audacious because it involved infiltrating the heart of the Mughal camp.
      <br>

      <b>The Raid on Lal Mahal </b>
      On the night of April 5, 1663, Shivaji led a daring raid on Lal Mahal. Disguised as a wedding procession, Shivaji
      and his select band of around 400 Maratha warriors entered the city of Pune. They moved swiftly and silently
      through the narrow lanes of the city, making their way to Lal Mahal.

      Once inside, they launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting Mughal soldiers. Shivaji personally led the
      assault on Shaista Khan's quarters. In the ensuing chaos, Shaista Khan was caught off guard. Although he managed
      to escape with his life, he lost his thumb to Shivaji's sword in the melee. <br>

      <b>Aftermath</b>
      Shaista Khan fled Pune, humiliated by the defeat and the loss of face before the Mughal Emperor. He was soon
      transferred to Bengal by Aurangzeb, effectively ending his campaign against Shivaji.

      This daring raid significantly boosted Shivaji's reputation as a brilliant military strategist. It demonstrated
      his ability to strike deep into enemy territory, causing panic and demoralizing the Mughal forces. The raid also
      underscored the effectiveness of guerrilla tactics against the larger and better-equipped Mughal army. <br>

      <b>Historical Impact</b>
      The defeat of Shaista Khan was a major setback for the Mughal Empire in the Deccan. It emboldened the Marathas and
      solidified Shivaji's position as a formidable force in the region. This victory contributed to the eventual
      establishment of the Maratha Empire and Shivaji's coronation as Chhatrapati (Emperor) in 1674.

      <figcaption style="margin: 0px 300px;">
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's last words were, "I leave, it's my time to go. Liberate Saptasindhu from the
        Yavanas, rescue Kashi Vishwanath, and bring the 12 Jyotirlingas into Hindavi Swaraj. Do not be off guard and
        fail"”

    </figure>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, passed away on April 3, 1680.
      His death marked the end of an era of his leadership and the beginning of significant changes in the Maratha
      Empire. Here's a detailed account of his death: <br>

      <b>Last Years of Shivaji Maharaj </b>
      In the final years of his life, Shivaji Maharaj continued to strengthen his empire and consolidate his hold over
      the territories he had acquired. He implemented various administrative reforms and established a sound governance
      system. His coronation as Chhatrapati in 1674 was a significant milestone, where he was officially crowned and
      recognized as an independent ruler.

      Despite facing challenges from the Mughals and other regional powers, Shivaji maintained his position through
      strategic alliances, military prowess, and his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers. <br>

      <b>Illness and Death</b>
      In the early months of 1680, Shivaji fell seriously ill. Historical accounts suggest he suffered from fever and
      dysentery, which gradually weakened him. Despite efforts to treat him, his condition worsened over time.

      On April 3, 1680, Shivaji Maharaj passed away at the age of 52 in his capital, Raigad Fort. His death was a
      significant blow to the Maratha Empire, as it left a power vacuum and led to internal struggles for succession.
      <br>

      <b>Succession Struggler </b>
      After Shivaji's death, a succession dispute arose between his sons, Sambhaji and Rajaram. Sambhaji, the elder son,
      eventually ascended the throne, but the period was marked by internal conflicts and external threats, particularly
      from the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb, who sought to reassert control over the Deccan region. <br>

      <b>Legacy</b>
      Shivaji Maharaj's legacy as a visionary leader, a skilled warrior, and an able administrator endured long after
      his death. He is remembered for his efforts to establish a sovereign Maratha state and for his contributions to
      the cultural and social fabric of the region. His strategies and policies continued to influence the Maratha
      Empire, which played a crucial role in the decline of Mughal dominance in India.
